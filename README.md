ComfyGallery is an image library for **ComfyUI** generated images. You can simply open a folder containing ComfyUI-generated images and retrieve detailed information about each image, such as:

- **Open Folder: Select your ComfyUI output folder (up to 50 images per page).**
- **Navigate Open Folders: Open and switch between multiple folders.**
- **Search: Look for keywords within your prompts.**
- **Filter Images: Sort images by newest or oldest.**
- **Image Details: Click an image to view its details in a separate window.**
- **Image Metadata: Access image resolution, prompts, checkpoint models, LoRA models, and seed numbers used for generation.**

This tool is incredibly useful for remembering which prompts and settings were used to generate specific images.
